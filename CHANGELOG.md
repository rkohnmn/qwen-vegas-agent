## [Unreleased] — Milestone 0

### Added

- Contract schemas and specs: words=1.0.0, speakers=1.0.0, catalog=1.0.0, edl=1.0.0, ops=1.0.0.
- Local config schema and secret redaction helpers.
- Cross-platform task runner, pinned dependency lock, valid/invalid fixture set, referential checks, and Milestone 0 docs.

### Changed

- Architecture updated to version 1.1.0 to reconcile the words gap index, catalog entry kinds, and the executor operation union with the Milestone 0 contract deliverables.
- Vegas notes moved to the canonical `docs/VEGAS_NOTES.md` path and bumped to 1.0.1. No Vegas behavior was verified.
